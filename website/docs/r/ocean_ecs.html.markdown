## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The Ocean cluster name.
* `cluster_name` - (Required) The ocean cluster name.
* `region` - (Required) The region the cluster will run in.
* `max_size` - (Optional, Default: `1000`) The upper limit of instances the cluster can scale up to.
* `min_size` - (Optional) The lower limit of instances the cluster can scale down to.
* `desired_capacity` - (Optional) The number of instances to launch and maintain in the cluster.
* `subnet_ids` - (Required) A comma-separated list of subnet identifiers for the Ocean cluster. Subnet IDs should be configured with auto assign public ip.

```hcl
  region = "us-west-2"
  name = "terraform-ecs-cluster"
  cluster_name = "terraform-ecs-cluster"

  max_size         = 2
  min_size         = 1
  desired_capacity = 2
  subnet_ids       = ["subnet-12345"]
```

* `whitelist` - (Optional) Instance types allowed in the Ocean cluster.

```hcl
whitelist = ["t1.micro", "m1.small"]
```

* `user_data` - (Optional) Base64-encoded MIME user data to make available to the instances.
* `image_id` - (Required) ID of the image used to launch the instances.
* `security_group_ids` - (Required) One or more security group ids.
* `key_pair` - (Optional) The key pair to attach the instances.
* `iam_instance_profile` - (Optional) The instance profile iam role.
* `associate_public_ip_address` - (Optional, Default: `false`) Configure public IP address allocation.
* `utilize_reserved_instances` - (Optional, Default `true`) If Reserved instances exist, OCean will utilize them before launching Spot instances.

* `monitoring` - (Optional) Enable detailed monitoring for cluster. Flag will enable Cloud Watch detailed detailed monitoring (one minute increments). Note: there are additional hourly costs for this service based on the region used.
* `ebs_optimized` - (Optional) Enable EBS optimized for cluster. Flag will enable optimized capacity for high bandwidth connectivity to the EB service for non EBS optimized instance types. For instances that are EBS optimized this flag will be ignored.

```hcl
  image_id                    = "ami-79826301"

* `cpu_per_unit` - (Optional) Optionally configure the number of CPUs to allocate the headroom. CPUs are denoted in millicores, where 1000 millicores = 1 vCPU.
* `memory_per_unit` - (Optional) Optionally configure the amount of memory (MB) to allocate the headroom.
* `num_of_units` - (Optional) The number of units to retain as headroom, where each unit has the defined headroom CPU and memory.
* `down` - (Optional) Auto Scaling scale down operations.
